# Hello World in Dragon

Hello World is the traditional first program for programmers across the globe, and here it is in Dragon. Hello World is as simple as it comes in Dragon - you can output/print data using the `print()` command in Dragon. All standard statements in Dragon end with `;` as seen in the code snippet below.

```js
print("Hello World!");
```
