# Operators

The majority of operators seen in programming languages are also seen within Dragon, including bitwise, mathematical and other operators, ordered in a clear hierarchy of precedence.

## Operators

- `**` - Exponent.
- `*` - Multiplication.
- `/` - Division.
- `+` - Addition.
- `-` - Subtraction.
- `%` - Modulus.
- `<<` - Bitwise left shift.
- `>>` - Bitwise right shift.
- `&` - Bitwise And.
- `^` - Bitwise XOR.
- `|` - Bitwise Or.
- `>` - Greater than.
- `<` - Lesser than.
- `==` - Equals to.
- `!=` - Not equals to.
- `in` - In.
- `and` - And.
- `or` - Or.

## Operators Precedence

Operators have a clear order of precedence, similair to mathematics where operations are done in a particular order (ordered from the top to the bottom with highest precedence at the top).

- `**`
- `/`, `*` and `%`
- `+` and `-`
- `<<` and `>>`
- `&`
- `|` and `^`
- `>` and `<`
- `==` and `!=`
- `in`, `and` and `or`
