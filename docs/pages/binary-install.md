# Installation

You can download the relevant binary by checking this [page](https://github.com/tomprograms/dragon/releases) and downloading the most recent release for your platform. In order to update, you must download a new binary.

## Usage

To run a file using Dragon, you must run the downloaded binary with the first argument being the filename.

```
$ dragon.exe test.drg
```

You can then use the Dragon shell by running:

```
$ dragon.exe
```

You could also run a file from within the Dragon shell, by importing the relevant file such as:

```
> import("./test.drg");
```

Next: [Hello World](./hello-world.md)
