## Installing

You can install Dragon using NodeJS by running:

```
$ npm i -g dragon-lang
```

Note: The ``-g`` flag is heavily recommended as it allows for global usage across your device and adds the ``dragon`` command to your device.

## Usage

You can then execute a file using Dragon by running:

```
$ dragon test.drg
```

You can use the Dragon shell by running:

```
$ dragon
```
